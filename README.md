# PUV_Processing
CPG PUV Processing Codes

Run PUV_code_combined.m -> does 1st set of QC, rotate to MOPS shorenormal, extracts bulk parameters, computes directional spectrum from MEM
PUV_stats_plots.m -> plot a bunch of different parameters, can be used for QCing further

Need to make an excel sheet that is specific to the deployment. See Ruby_2D_Notes.xlsx for example.
